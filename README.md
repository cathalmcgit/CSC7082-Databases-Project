## Viewing the Database
- Once the repository is cloned, or the files downloaded, XAMPP will be needed to view the database.
- With XAMPP installed locally, start the control panel, then start the Apache and MySQL modules and select 'Admin' in the MySQL module to open the database view in a browser window.
- Finally, create an empty database and populate it by importing the jet2holidays booking database.sql file. 
- Sample Data and queries are included to demonstrate the database.
